[Actors](/actors) representes a new section. In the `tools` section, [Wallets](/tools/wallets) have been added. `Actors` is still fairly incomplete and `Wallets` might be inconsistent or incomplete, but they get published to gather some early feedback.

The [Contribution Policy](/about/contribution-policy) page has been added and lays out how you can contribute.

Next steps:
- Crawl past grants to find more material
- add the PSP standards
- after that I will just keep crawling through the existing material to discover missing things and find more interesting stuff in the Polakdot web

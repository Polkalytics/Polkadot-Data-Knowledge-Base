authors: anb

Two major sections have been added: [Tools](/tools/) and [Data](/data/). Tools include [Libraries](/tools/libraries/), [Explorers](/tools/explorers/) & [Dashboards](/tools/dashboards). Data includes [Datasets](/data/datasets) and [APIs](/data/apis/)


This marks the introduction of some of the major categories of this project. Categories might get fine-tuned as more data is added. 

Next steps include:
- Reaching out to the mentioned projects to give them a chance to fine-tune their entries, add content/links, change copy etc.
- *Maybe* define schemas for the categories and add special renderings
- Add the `Actors` category as next major section

The [Contribution Policy](/about/contribution-policy) page has been added and lays out how you can contribute.

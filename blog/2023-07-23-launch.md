Welcome to the Polkadot Data Knowledge Base! 

Getting started with data in Polkadot is tough. There are dozens of technologies and at least as many tools to explore them. Working your way through this jungle can be time-consuming. This is where the Polkadot Data Knowledge Base comes to your rescue.

This knowledge base will provide a comprehensive overview of all things data in the Polkadot ecosystem. Today the Polkadot Data Knowledge Base launches with the first chapter: [Research & Knowledge](/knowledge). This chapter contains references the foundational knowledge about Polkadot & Substrate, relevant discussion pages, glossaries, and reports.

This website is provided to you by [Polkalytics](https://www.polkalytics.io/) and is sponsored by the Polkadot Treasury via [Motion 407](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/407). Feel free to send your feedback as direct message to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob) or [Telegram](https://t.me/alice_und_bob): @alice_und_bob, or file a pull request in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Polkalytics/Polkadot-Data-Knowledge-Base).

In the coming weeks, the chapters Actors & Events, Tech & Exploration, and Standards & Data will follow.

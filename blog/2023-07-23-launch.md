Welcome to the Polkadot Data Knowledge Base! This knowlede base will be a comprehensive overview of the current state of all things data in the Polkadot ecosystem. It was supported by the Polkadot Treasury in [Motion 407](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/407).

Today the Polkadot Data Knowledge Base launches with the first chapter: [Research & Knowledge](/docs/knowledge). This chapter contains references the foundational knowledge about Polkadot & Substrate, relevant discussion pages, glossaries, and reports.

Feel free to send your feedback as direct message to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob) or [Telegram](https://t.me/alice_und_bob): @alice_und_bob, or file a pull request in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Polkalytics/Polkadot-Data-Knowledge-Base).

In the coming weeks, the chapters Actors & Events, Tech & Exploration, and Standards & Data will follow.

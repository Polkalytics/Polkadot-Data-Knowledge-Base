## Style guide

The knowledge base should be sufficiently neutral to maintain equidistance to competing projects. To do this, we avoid marketing-speak and try to describe the projects as dry as possible. Competing projects might see mirrored language.

If you want to contribute in your own words, you can do so. To do this, please append your personalized text after a headline to the effect of

`## NAME in their own words`

and make all consecutive headlines one layer below. (`### etc`).

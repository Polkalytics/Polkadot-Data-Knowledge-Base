# Polkascan Explorer
*Block Explorer*

A block explorer that is not as enduser-friendly as [Subscan](./subscan), but can delight analysts by offering a fuller picture on blocks, transactions, inherents, extrinsics, events, and logs in the web view, in case you need that. An additional features is that it allows you to inspect the previous runtime versions by pallets, allowing you to see indexes of call functions, events, storage functions, constants, and error messages.

# doTreasury
*Treasury Explorer*

doTreasury highlights the Polkadot, Kusama, and Edgeware treasuries and gives insights into how value flows in and out. It allows you to explore current and historical treasury proposals, tips, bounties, etc. A great feature is that you can inspect accounts and see all their activities in relation to the treasury.

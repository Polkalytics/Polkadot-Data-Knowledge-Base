# Chopsticks
Chopsticks provides a developer-friendly method of locally forking existing Substrate based chains. It allows for the replaying of blocks to easily examine how extrinsics effect state, the forking of multiple blocks for XCM testing, and more. This allows developers to test and experiment with their own custom blockchain configurations in a local development environment, without the need to deploy a live network.

Overall, Chopsticks aims to simplify the process of building blockchain applications on Substrate and make it accessible to a wider range of developers.

It is maintained by Acala.
